This repository contains the code and resources for Homework 3 of the iOS Development course at Cubstart. The goal of this homework is to create a simple iOS app that uses the UITableView component to display a list of items.

# Requirements

The app should meet the following requirements:

The app should have a UITableView component that displays a list of items.
The list of items should be populated from a JSON file that is included in the app bundle.
Each item in the list should display a thumbnail image, a title, and a subtitle.
Tapping on an item in the list should display a detail view with more information about the item.
The detail view should display the full-size image, the title, the subtitle, and a longer description of the item.
The app should have a custom app icon and launch screen.

# Getting Started

To run the app, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Xcode.
Build and run the app in the iOS Simulator or on a physical iOS device.
